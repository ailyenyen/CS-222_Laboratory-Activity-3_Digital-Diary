# 📓 Digital Diary (C# Console Application)

## 📌 Project Description  
**Digital Diary** is a console-based C# application that allows users to write, view, delete, modify, and search diary entries. It demonstrates effective file handling and object-oriented programming principles. All entries are timestamped and stored in a local text file (`diary.txt`).

---

## ✨ Features
- ✍️ Write new diary entries with automatic timestamps  
- 📖 View all saved entries  
- 🔍 Search entries by date (`YYYY-MM-DD` format)  
- 🗑️ Delete specific entries  
- ✏️ Modify existing entries  
- 🖥️ Clean and user-friendly console interface  

---

## 🔧 How OOP Principles Are Used

- **Encapsulation**: Internal file handling logic is managed within the `Diary` class using private fields and public methods.  
- **Abstraction**: Complex operations like writing or searching entries are simplified through user-facing methods like `WriteEntry()` and `SearchByDate()`.  
- **Modularity**: Code is split across multiple files to improve organization and readability.  
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism** *(optional)*: These can be extended in future versions for more entry types or UI commands.
