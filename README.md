# Project Description

The Digital Diary is a console-based C# application that allows users to write, view, and search diary entries. It demonstrates file handling through an object-oriented programming approach. All diary entries are stored in a text file (diary.txt) and timestamped automatically.

# Features

-Write new diary entries with the current timestamp

- View all saved entries

- Search for entries by date (format: YYYY-MM-DD)

- Simple and user-friendly console interface

- Deletes and modifies diary entries

# Object-Oriented Programming Principles Used

- Encapsulation: The Diary class hides the internal logic and file handling using private fields and public methods.

- Abstraction: Provides a simplified interface (WriteEntry, ViewAllEntries, SearchByDate) for complex file operations.

- Modularity: Code is organized into separate files for better readability and maintainability.

# Instructions on Running the App
