# üìì Digital Diary (C# Console Application)

üìå Project Description
Digital Diary is a console-based C# application that allows users to write, view, delete, modify, and search diary entries. It demonstrates effective file handling and object-oriented programming principles. All entries are timestamped and stored in a local text file (diary.txt).

# Features

-Write new diary entries with the current timestamp

- View all saved entries

- Search for entries by date (format: YYYY-MM-DD)

- Simple and user-friendly console interface

- Deletes and modifies diary entries

# Object-Oriented Programming Principles Used

- Encapsulation: The Diary class hides the internal logic and file handling using private fields and public methods.

- Abstraction: Provides a simplified interface (WriteEntry, ViewAllEntries, SearchByDate) for complex file operations.

- Modularity: Code is organized into separate files for better readability and maintainability.
